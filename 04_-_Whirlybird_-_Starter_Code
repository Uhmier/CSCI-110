# Define a function called get_number_selection that takes one parameter named
# smaller_numbers. The parameter will be a boolean value. The function should
# prompt the user to enter an integer and return their selection as an integer.
# If smaller_numbers is True, the user should be prompted to input a number
# between 1 and 4, inclusively. If smaller_numbers is False, the user should be
# prompted to input a number between 5 and 8, inclusively. No other input values
# should ever be allowed and only valid values should be returned.

# Define a function called play that takes no parameters. The function should
# use the other functions you have defined to handle the overall logic of the
# whirlybird. First, the user should be prompted to enter a question for the
# whirlybird. The user should be prompted to choose a color. If there are an
# even number of letters in that color, the user should be prompted to select a
# number on [1, 4]. If there are an odd number of letters in their color, the
# user should be prompted to select a number on [5, 8]. If the number they
# select is even, they should be presented with the same numbers again; if the
# number they select is odd, they should be presented with the other set of
# numbers. The second number the user selects should determine the fortune they
# recieve. Finally, the user's question and their fortune should be printed out.
